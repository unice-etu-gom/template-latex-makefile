\chapter{Bibliography}

In this template, bibliography is held in the directory \texttt{30-backmatter/bibliography/}.

Entries are declared in \texttt{.bib} files.

When an entry is used in the document, it will appear in the Bibliography table.
By default, bibliography entries are not visible until they are in use. To
change this behaviour, use the \verb|\nocite{*}| command (have a look at the
commented line in the \texttt{00-header/bibliography.tex} file).

\section{Citations}

\subsection{Description}

A citation creates a reference to a bibliography item. There's two kind of
citation : visible and invisible ones.

Visibles ones will create a mark in the document which will behave as an
hyperlink.

Invisible citations will not be visible in the document, but the entry they
refer to will be visible in the bibliography table.


\subsection{Usage}

Visible citations:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \cite{<label>}
\end{lstlisting}


Invisible citations:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \nocite{<label>}
\end{lstlisting}
